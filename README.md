# Module 9 Assignment: Final Project
## Create an MVC Web Application

Welcome to FindAnime! The purpose of this web application is to provide users who have an interest in Anime, one place where they browse and search for different shows out there without having to open mulitple streaming sites. This website provides information on each selected show and even navigates the user to where it can be streamed. There is also an option to login/signup to access the watchlist page which allows users to create a list of shows they'd like to watch.

I decided to create this web application due to past experiences of struggling to find websites that provided the information I was looking for about a specific anime (It can be pretty annoying having to jump site to site just to find out how many movies one show has). I also felt having a watchlist component would be convenient as well since having one watchlist on one site instead of five on five different streaming sites can be helpful.

## Issues
I did have some difficulties implementing the CRUD operations
